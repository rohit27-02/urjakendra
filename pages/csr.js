                <p className='my-4 text-sm font-medium'>CL Educate is truly committed to its responsibility towards society and has an active Corporate Social Responsibility program. We focus on a two pronged approach to making a true impact on society - environmental and social.</p>
                <h1 className='border-b-2 py-1 border-gray-800 text-xl border-dotted'>Environmental</h1>
                <p className='my-4 text-sm font-medium'>CL Educate believes ownership to be a key contributor to making sure our environment stays clean and healthy, and strives to consistently improve its quality. Energy conservation is very well ingrained in our employees and systems.</p>
                <p className='my-4 text-sm font-medium'>We try to keep all our communications and databases involved in HR processes and appraisals strictly online, resulting in considerable reduction in paper usage. All our employees are paper conscious and print only when absolutely necessary. Our commitment to staying green can be gauged by the fact that when we recently procured new servers, which are eco-responsible servers, Sun Fire T2000s.</p>
                <p className='my-4 text-sm font-medium'>In addition to our own efforts, CL Educate also encourages and supports endeavors to make a difference to our environment. For instance, we supported and endorsed a team of 8 engineers from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology in New Delhi in their quest for making a solar powered car, which they eventually drove in a rally during the World Solar Racing Competition in Pretoria, South Africa and ended up on the podium with a runners-up spot. While this does not fall under the college activities/events that CL periodically sponsors, this was a unique project, and was in line with our stay green commitment to the environment. CL is proud of these 8 young engineers for thinking green.</p>
